# Auth Client Package

This package provides a framework-agnostic authentication client built on `oidc-client-ts`.
It handles the low-level OIDC communication with Ory Hydra and Kratos.

## Usage

This client is typically wrapped by framework-specific hooks or components (e.g., in the `ui` package for React applications).
